## Unique Sudoku Generator with processing 3

Press space to generate new sudokus with unique solutions!
You can always press s to solve it with the recursive backtracker algorithm

Here are the description of algorithms used in this project :

1.[Recursive Backtracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms#Backtracking)
2.The generation of the sudoku was inspired by [This algorithm posted in geeksforgeeks by Ankur Trisal]   (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-sudoku-generator/) although it did not help create a unique sudoku. I had to make my own algorithm and merge it with that one.

This version of my Sudoku Generator only generates easy sudokus. I am trying to improve it to control the difficulty level.
